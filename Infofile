Step 1: Get started with Slack

Slack is a collaboration platform that allows teams to communicate and work together in one place. Before integrating AgeBot into Slack, you'll need to create a Slack workspace. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a Slack workspace for your AgeBot project:

Go to the Slack homepage at https://slack.com/ and click the "Get started for free" button.

Enter your email address and click "Create a new workspace."

Fill out the required information, such as your workspace name, and click "Create Workspace."

Follow the prompts to invite team members, set up channels, and customize your workspace. You can create channels for specific topics, invite team members to collaborate and customize your workspace with themes and emojis.

Once you've finished setting up your workspace, you can start using Slack and integrating your AgeBot project into it.


Step 2: Setting up the Slack Workspace for AgeBot Project

To integrate your AgeBot project with Slack, you will need to set up a Slack app and create a bot user. Here's how to set up your Slack workspace for the AgeBot project:

Go to the Slack API homepage at https://api.slack.com/ and click "Create an app" in the top right corner.

Select "From scratch" and enter a name for your app. Then, select the workspace you want to add your app to.

In the "Add features and functionality" section, click on "Bots" and then add bot scope 1. chat:write, im:history." This will enable your bot to write messages and access message history.

    4. Give your bot a display name and default username. This will be the name that appears when the bot sends messages.

    5. Click on "Install App" and then "Install App to Workspace." This will generate an OAuth Access Token that you can use to authenticate your app with the Slack API.

    6. Copy the Bot User OAuth Access Token from the "OAuth & Permissions" page. This is your bot token and will be used to authorize your bot's communication with Slack.

    7. To get your app token, click on "Basic Information" in the left-hand menu and then scroll down to "App-Level Tokens." Click "Create App-Level Token" and then add "connections:write" as a scope. Copy the newly created token.

    8. Click on Socket Mode and enable Socket Mode. This allows your bot to receive events from Slack in real time.

   9.  Add event subscription message:im to subscribe to message events sent to your bot.

   10. Now that you have your bot token and app token, you can use them to authenticate your AgeBot project with the Slack API and start communicating with your bot in Slack.

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up a fully functional Slack workspace for your AgeBot project and start using it to calculate the ages of users.
